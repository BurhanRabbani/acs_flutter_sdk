## Why We Lost 20 Points

### Issue 1: Repository URLs (10 points lost)

**Problem:**
```yaml
repository: https://github.com/yourusername/acs_flutter_sdk
```

**Pana Check:**
- Pana validates that repository URLs follow proper format
- Placeholder URLs like "yourusername" are flagged as invalid
- Points deducted for non-standard repository URLs

**Solution:**
```yaml
repository: https://github.com/BurhanRabbani/acs_flutter_sdk
```

### Issue 2: URLs Unreachable (10 points lost)

**Problem:**
- Pana attempts to fetch the URLs to verify they exist
- Placeholder URLs return HTTP 404 (Not Found)
- Points deducted for unreachable URLs

**Solution:**
- Create actual GitHub repository
- URLs will return HTTP 200 (OK)
- Pana will verify repository is accessible

---

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

**Option A: Web Interface (Easiest)**

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `acs_flutter_sdk`
   - **Description:** `Flutter plugin for Microsoft Azure Communication Services (ACS). Provides voice/video calling, chat, and identity management capabilities.`
   - **Visibility:** ✅ **Public** (required!)
   - **Initialize:** ❌ Do NOT check any boxes
3. Click "Create repository"

**Option B: GitHub CLI**

```bash
gh repo create acs_flutter_sdk \
  --public \
  --description "Flutter plugin for Microsoft Azure Communication Services (ACS). Provides voice/video calling, chat, and identity management capabilities."
```

---

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

```bash
# Push to GitHub (you're already set up!)
git push -u origin main
```

**Expected output:**
```
Enumerating objects: 101, done.
Counting objects: 100% (101/101), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (95/95), done.
Writing objects: 100% (101/101), 123.45 KiB | 12.34 MiB/s, done.
Total 101 (delta 15), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/BurhanRabbani/acs_flutter_sdk.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

---

### Step 3: Verify Repository

1. Visit: https://github.com/BurhanRabbani/acs_flutter_sdk
2. Verify:
   - ✅ Repository is public
   - ✅ All files are present (101 files)
   - ✅ README.md displays correctly
   - ✅ LICENSE file is visible

---

### Step 4: Run Pana Analysis

```bash
# Quick check
flutter pub publish --dry-run

# Detailed pana analysis
dart pub global activate pana
pana --no-warning .
```

**Expected output:**
```
Package score: 160/160 points

✅ 20/20 points: Follow Dart file conventions
✅ 10/10 points: Provide documentation
✅ 20/20 points: Platform support
✅ 50/50 points: Pass static analysis
✅ 40/40 points: Support up-to-date dependencies
✅ 10/10 points: Support repository URLs
✅ 10/10 points: Homepage/Documentation URLs reachable

Package has 0 warnings.

## Verification Checklist

Before running pana, verify:

- ✅ pubspec.yaml updated with correct URLs
- ✅ Local git repository initialized
- ✅ Initial commit created (101 files)
- ✅ Remote 'origin' configured
- ⏳ GitHub repository created (you need to do this)
- ⏳ Code pushed to GitHub (you need to do this)
- ⏳ Repository is public (you need to verify this)
- ⏳ Pana analysis run (you need to do this)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: "remote: Repository not found"
**A:** You need to create the repository on GitHub first. Go to https://github.com/new

### Q: "Authentication failed"
**A:** Use a Personal Access Token or set up SSH keys:
```bash
# For HTTPS with token
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/BurhanRabbani/acs_flutter_sdk.git

# Or switch to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:BurhanRabbani/acs_flutter_sdk.git
```

### Q: "Pana still shows 140/160"
**A:** 
1. Make sure repository is created and public
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to index
3. Clear pana cache: `rm -rf ~/.pub-cache/`
4. Run pana again

### Q: "URLs still unreachable"
**A:**
1. Verify repository is **public** (not private)
2. Check URLs manually in browser
3. Make sure repository name is exactly `acs_flutter_sdk`
